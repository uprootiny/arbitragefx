# Prompt History (abridged)

This file captures the key user prompts and instructions from this session.

## User prompts (chronological, condensed)
- Provide AGENTS instructions and environment context.
- Design and implement a rolling backtesting engine; define strategy API/state layout; keep writing decisions to a file.
- Produce a "silver-bullet" implementation; proceed with obvious suspects; discuss realistic signals and infrastructures.
- Implement backtesting algos and shovel-layer logs; emphasize execution realism.
- Build event detection and strategy hypotheses; focus on feasible, exchange-agnostic data.
- Implement ground-level, load-bearing code; run tests; get data and backtest.
- Diagnose brittleness/wishful thinking/sloppy engineering; then implement fixes.
- Save prompt history into a file and write a dev journal.
