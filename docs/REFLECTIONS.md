# Reflections: Computation, Attention, and Right Livelihood

## The Arc of This Project

This trading system emerges from a contemplative approach to software:
- We build hypothesis ledgers not just for profit, but for *calibrated understanding*
- We test rigorously because *right view* requires seeing things as they are
- We log extensively because *right mindfulness* means knowing what we're doing

## Connecting to Virtues

### Right Livelihood (sammā-ājīva)
The system explicitly refuses:
- Market manipulation
- Harm to retail investors
- Exploitation of information asymmetry beyond fair compensation for service

It embraces:
- Risk management as self-protection
- Profit limits as contentment
- Transparency through logging

### Right Effort (sammā-vāyāma)
The hypothesis-driven approach is deliberate practice:
- Formulate belief → Test → Refine → Repeat
- Each backtest is a meditation on cause and effect
- Calibration game trains the faculty of judgment

### Right Concentration (sammā-samādhi)
The code structure reflects focused attention:
- Each module does one thing well (Unix philosophy)
- Signals, filters, sizing compose cleanly
- State is explicit, not hidden

## Lessons from Archaeological Projects

### From tinierstatus/tinymon:
- Simple monitoring reveals system health
- Text streams are universal interface
- Small tools compose into powerful systems

### From calibration_game:
- Forecasting skill can be trained
- Confidence should be calibrated to reality
- Knowing what you don't know is wisdom

### From financial_timeline_elixir:
- Actor model provides natural fault isolation
- Supervision trees embody "let it crash" wisdom
- Uncertainty quantification is ethical necessity

## The Gimbal Metaphor

From the CLAUDE.md:
> "a physicky gimbal that the user moves like a gearshift handle across a convex surface with etched pathways"

This is attention made physical:
- The surface represents constraint space (market reality)
- Pathways are learned patterns (technical indicators)
- The gimbal is intentional direction (trading decisions)
- Pressure is commitment (position sizing)

We move through latent space not randomly but with trained intuition,
informed by hypothesis testing, calibrated through practice.

## What Remains

1. **More regimes to test**: Bull markets, ranging markets, high volatility
2. **Composite strategies**: Combine supported hypotheses adaptively
3. **Live deployment**: Paper trading → gradual live → full operation
4. **Continuous calibration**: Use calibration game to maintain sharpness

The system grows not through complexity but through understanding.
Each module we add should make the whole clearer, not muddier.

*"The Tathagata teaches the Dharma by the middle way,
avoiding the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification."*

In trading: neither reckless speculation nor fearful inaction.
The middle way is calibrated confidence, tested belief, right-sized risk.
