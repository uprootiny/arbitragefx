# Hypothesis + Evidence Workflow

## Workflow
1. Add a hypothesis to `HYPOTHESIS_LEDGER.md`.
2. Define tests in `docs/backtest-loops.md` and/or issue a run.
3. Add evidence to `EVIDENCE_LOG.md` with artifact paths.
4. Update status + decision.

## Guardrails
- No hypothesis without scope + constraints.
- No evidence without source.
- No decision without summary rationale.
